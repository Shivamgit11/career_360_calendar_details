# Event Analytics Dashboard

This is a simple React app that shows events on a calendar. You can see data for different dates and view it in a bar graph.

---

## What This App Does

- Shows a calendar using **React Big Calendar**.
- You can switch the calendar view between **Month**, **Week**, or **Day**.
- Some dates have dummy data (example data).
- When you click a date with data, a bar graph will pop up and show that data.
- If no data is available for a date, it shows an alert message:  
  "No data found for the selected date."
- Uses **Redux** to manage the selected date.
